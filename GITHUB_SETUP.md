üöÄ REPOSITORY SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Since we need to create the GitHub repository first, please follow these steps:

METHOD 1: Create via GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
========================================================
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - Repository name: project-context-mcp
   - Description: A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for unified project context and monitoring
   - Visibility: Public
   - ‚ùå Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"

METHOD 2: Create via GitHub CLI (if you have auth set up)
========================================================
Run this command:
gh repo create wblair8689/project-context-mcp --public --description "A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for unified project context and monitoring"

AFTER CREATING THE REPOSITORY:
===============================
Run this command to push the code:
cd /Users/Shared/project-context-mcp && git push -u origin main

‚úÖ The local repository is ready to push!
‚úÖ All files are committed and ready to go!
‚úÖ Remote origin is configured correctly!
